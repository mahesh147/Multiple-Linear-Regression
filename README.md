# Multiple-Linear-Regression

A very simple python program to implement Multiple Linear Regression from scratch using numpy and other basic libraries.

Here we calculated the cost , Gradient and the hypothesis.

Here in this python file, you can train any multiple linear regression dataset, you can select your own learning rate and also number of epochs.

Hope you like the solution and would help others to learn from this.
